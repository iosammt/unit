# unit

Next Generation Visual Programming Platform

## unit

unit is a General Purpose Visual Programming Language and Environment built with a primary focus on Developer Experience. It is heavily inspired by Data Flow Programming, Reactive Programming, Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming paradigms. Formally, units are Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) Finite State Machines (FSE). A program in unit is represented as a Graph.

The unit Programming Language was developed in close junction to the unit Programming Environment, which is a Web application built for easy composition of new units. The environment is designed to feel visual and kinesthetic, giving the perception of Direct Manipulation of Live Virtual Objects, while providing a minimalistic, distraction-free and ergonomic Programming experience; furthermore, new ways of performing Software Development are explored in the UX, such as Programming by Voice and Programming by Drawing. 

unit's Philosophy is similar to the Unix Operating System's; for a seasoned programmer, unit should feel like the 2D evolution of the Command Line Interface (CLI) where units' (commands) inputs (stdin) and outputs (stdout) can be piped together into a graph (script); moreover, the unit system is set to grow into a modern and approachable Web Operating System which is sandboxed by default, enabling a new era of Software Sharing and Collaboration.

The broader Design Principles behind unit are discussed in [Concept](src/concept/README.md).

To jump right into the official unit Programming Environment (Beta), visit [ioun.it](https://ioun.it).

The following is a manual on how to run a local version of the unit Programming Environment.

## Installation

Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you haven't aready.

Clone this repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:samuelmtimbo/unit.git
```
Get into the unit folder:
```
cd unit
```
Install dependencies and build:
```
yarn
```
Start a local unit server:
```
yarn start
```
For development mode:
```
yarn watch
```
## Documentation

As an application, the unit Programming Environment was designed to be learnable by Experimentation and Exploration; visual and written documentation can be found inside the platform. For a step-by-step introduction to unit Programming, visit [Getting Started](https://start.ioun.it).

This codebase is a TypeScript implementation of the unit Programming Language Spec with an accompanying Web based Programming Environment. We tried to make it as clean and organized as we could while still maintaining a space for experimentation. Some folders contain a ```README.md``` file with information about that piece of the architecture.

## Contributing

unit has been developed by a single Software Engineer, [Samuel Timb√≥](https://github.com/samuelmtimbo), working since 2017, first as a personal project and then later as a full-time job. 

We would like to maintain the same level of creative freedom, invention, and intimacy that motivated and made the project possible; that said, if you would like to directly participate in the development of Open Source unit, hit me up at [@io_sammt](https://twitter.com/io_sammt).

## Community

If you have a question or a suggestion related to Open Source unit, or if you just want to talk about the Future of Programming, feel free to DM me at [@io_sammt](https://twitter.com/io_sammt).

We hope you enjoy the unit concept and invite you to join our community!
