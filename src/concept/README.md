# Concept

"We dream of a world where everyone is connected through a powerful, singular, infinite, open, distributed and accessible general computer system. Let's start by rethinking the way we make Software."

For that we propose unit:

unit is based on a fundamental Law of Computing: 

"Every software system can be thought of as a composition of input and output (IO) machines through which the data will be transported and transformed."

This forms the base of Flow-based Programming; as a Programming Language, unit is also heavily inspired by Functional Programming and Reactive Programming. 

The unit paradigm was specially designed to enable easy visual creation of programs called units, which can be created by piping and collapsing together smaller units, in a process called Composition. unit's fundamentals are not new by themselves - in fact, unit represents a purposeful re-exploration of Computer Science principles in the context of modern Software Development.

The simplicity of Programming in unit comes from the recursive application of a very small set of principles. Namely, three concepts perfectly define everything about unit: Core, Connection and Composition - one starts with an initial set of units (Core) which can be tied together (Connection) forming a new graph unit (Composition). Moreover, any software can be built by repeatedly taping into those. 

The concept of a unit is essentially an advancement of the fundamental concept of a function, common to many Textual Programming Languages, such as JavaScript; a function is supposed to be given an ordered list of arguments as input and can return a single datum as output. A unit, on the other hand, can receive and send data at any time, in any order and through multiple inputs and outputs. We believe that redefining the fundamental building block of Programming as a unit can exponentially reduce Software Complexity. 

A code drawn in unit is simply a Directed Graph. This is basically the same implicit representational model programmers might have in mind for understanding how programs work, or in better words, how inputs are progressively transformed into desired outputs. This way, unit removes steps that separate Software Architecture from Software Development; the pseudo code, the code and the program become the one thing.

The conception of unit was paved over years observing the accumulated frustration the modern programmer has to go through to express even simple constructs in written code. Models that are easy o express often map to disproportionally big complexity and often need to be implemented from scratch, especially when one's feeling creative.

Systems built on top of traditional Textual Programming Languages became so complex and heterogeneous developers lost much of their ability to understand and control their own code, rendering a weak ecosystem where every individual piece of Software cannot be decomposed neither reused, much less integrated with in a plug and play manner. We believe this is a reflex of an industry that failed to incorporate many rather fundamental principles of Systems Programming and its intersection with Cognitive Psychology.

The current state of art of Programming imposes a tall barrier of entry for people that would be otherwise interested in making small software. This renders people hostage to the specific design decisions of many one-size-fits-all apps, which are usually borderline impossible to customize or extend. 

By making conceptually simple programs simple to express visually, the user can be quickly taught to build useful machines that can, between many things, automate otherwise repetitive tasks all by himself, a practice we are calling Personal Programming in contrast with Professional Software Engineering, further blurring the line between user and developer.
