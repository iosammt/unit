# Dao of Open Source Incubation

## Built-in

One interesting thing about Open Source unit is that there's no enforced tie with any centralized service

So it kinda makes sense to integrate with all other open decentralized protocols out there

Many times falling back to some "default" service, such as "ioun.it" for STUN/TURN and "livepeer.com" form Streaming

The user can always change the default to another service that is compatible with the concept of RTMP for instance 

## Matrix for Communication 

At the same time also centralized services that combine The Power of Centralization + Open Protocols

So unit is ideologically inert

Open Source unit will be only opinionated through defaults, strings inside JSONs, which is still a powerful power to have as the owner

That model alone will reduce my development work in a 1000%

It is so subtle

We will go to Goa soon my friends

## Great Connector

Unit will be the Great Connector, that one app that brought up everyone and everything into a single platform

That reminded me of your Incubator idea, Lucy

Any business that implements an Open Standard is automatically a unit Partner

So we could simply pick the ones we like the most 

Unit's end game is much closer than I anticipated

## Immortal

I discussed this concept with Lag; we can immortalize unit in an NFT on IPFS that can be verified, so the user will know for sure that the app he is using has all the guarantees that are spec'ed on the official Manifesto

That could be one Victor's entrepreneurial pursuit, some badass Open Distributed Backend service(s) and brand(s)

## Movement

We will continuously grow just by following a series of "first mover" moves
