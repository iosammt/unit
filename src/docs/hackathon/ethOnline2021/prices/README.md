# Got high and decided to play a dangerous game:

## Chainlink
We intend to deploy a Smart Contract through unit (our Visual Programming Language) that taps into Chainlink's Data Feeds and API Calls feature.

## IPFS / Filecoin
The unit user can programmatically manipulate many sorts of multimedia, such as text, image, audio and video. We plan to integrate with IPFS for arbitrary file storage (Web3.Storage) and the minting and storage of NFTs (NFT.Storage).

## Livepeer
Using Livepeer's Web RTMP service, the user should be able to leverage unit to start an audio/video live stream to Livepeer's network directly from the browser. On the stream consumer side, the user should be able to capture samples (images, for example) of the live stream and store them in the form of a NFT.

## SKALE Labs
Unit will the first Visual Reactive Data Flow Programming Language that can be directly transpiled to Solidity Smart Contracts which are easier to understand by end user. Since there's an inherent cost to this abstraction, we plan to use SKALE gasless network as the first layer of out Visual Smart Contract system.
